# Resume Creator

This is a super simple resume template which can be extended to be more dynamic.

## How to use

- Install dependencies 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the simple http server which will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 and will watch for changes to the sass file
  ```
  npm run watch
  ```
- Adjust text in the index.html manually (for now)
- Adjust the location of the .page-break css class (`@media print` section) and test printing to PDF
